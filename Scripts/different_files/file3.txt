Once upon a time, there was a couple named Alex and Samantha. They had been married for many years and had built a happy life together. They lived in a small house on the edge of a forest, surrounded by beautiful nature. They enjoyed long walks in the woods, where they would often see deer and other wildlife.

One day, while they were out for a walk, they came across a lost puppy. The puppy was thin and dirty, and it looked like it had been wandering for some time. Alex and Samantha knew that they had to help, so they brought the puppy home and cleaned it up. They named him Max and he quickly became a beloved member of the family.

Alex and Samantha took turns caring for Max and he brought them joy every day. They were grateful for the love and companionship he provided, and they knew that he was meant to be a part of their lives. They were glad to have given a home to a lost puppy and Max was glad to have found a home with loving family.
