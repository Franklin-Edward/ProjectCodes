Once upon a time, there was a family named the Williams. The father, Robert, worked as a banker and the mother, Sarah, was a stay-at-home mom. They had a son, Michael, who was studying abroad in Europe. They also had three dogs, a Golden Retriever named Bella, a Labrador Retriever named Max and a German Shepherd named Rocky.
The family missed Michael terribly while he was away, but they stayed in touch through video calls and emails. Sarah would often tell Michael about the adventures of Bella, Max, and Rocky, and how much they missed him.
One day, Michael surprised his family by flying home for the holidays. The Williams were overjoyed to see him and the three dogs were ecstatic. They jumped and barked with joy, tails wagging and tongues lolling. Michael couldn't believe how much they had grown, Bella, Max and Rocky showered him with love and licks, which Michael happily returned.
During his stay, Michael spent most of his time catching up with his parents, and bonding with his beloved pets. The family took long walks, played fetch and snuggled on the couch together.
The time flew by, and before they knew it, Michael had to return to Europe. The family was sad to see him go, but they knew they would always be connected through their love for each other and their three beloved dogs.
